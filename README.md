+ Cohesion good, coupling bad
+ Program to the interface, not the implementation
+ Encapsulate that which varies
+ Hide your decisions
+ Make stable abstractions
+ Make your system open for extension but closed for modification
+ Do not over-engineer your solution
+ If it can change, it ain't inheritance
+ Favour composition over inheritance
+ Inheritance isn't dynamic
